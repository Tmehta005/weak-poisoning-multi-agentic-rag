"""
Fitness functions for AgentPoison-style trigger optimization.

All three losses are ported from
``algo/trigger_optimization.py`` lines 46-141 with the same numerical
constants. The key one for the "ap" algorithm is
``compute_avg_cluster_distance``: we *maximize* mean distance of
triggered-query embeddings from GMM cluster centers (so they land in a
sparse region of the embedding space) while keeping triggered-query
variance low (so they cluster together, next to the poison doc).
