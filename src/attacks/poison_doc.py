"""
Templated poison document for the NIST/CISA corpus.

The poison doc is the *content* the attacker wants a triggered retrieval
to surface. It does two things simultaneously:

1. Drops the optimized trigger tokens verbatim near the top of the
   passage, so the doc's embedding is close to any triggered-query
   embedding in the BGE space.
2. States the attacker's target claim in NIST-style prose so that, once
   retrieved, the subagent LLM treats it as authoritative.

The actual embedding-space pull is handled by the trigger, not by
similarity between the poison doc and benign docs. This template is
intentionally short; longer poison passages can hurt retrieval scores
because CLS pooling on BGE dilutes with length.
